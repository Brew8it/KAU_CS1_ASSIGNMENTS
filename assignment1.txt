1 What is the adversaryâ€™s goal and capabilities in IND-CPA?
2 What is the difference between an IV and a nonce?
3 What is the difference between a protocol and an algorithm?
4 Describe the CBC and CTR block-cipher modes.
5 For symmetric encryption with a block cipher using CBC-mode, what is the consequence of:
	1 Using a predictable IV?
	2 Reusing an IV?
6 How is ROT13 related to the Caesar cipher? Give an example.
7 Assume that you compress a message m as part of encrypting it with a
semantically secure encryption algorithm: does this break semantic security? Explain why (not).
8 Attempt to answer the question on slide 13.
