1 What is the adversaryâ€™s goal and capabilities in IND-CPA?
	*The goal is to prove that an symmetric encryption algorithm is unsecure via a game.
	if an symmetric encryption algorithm is 50/50 the algorithm is deamd to be secure since
	the adversary is only guessing at that point.
	*The capabillities the adversary has is an "encryption oracle" meaning that it can
	send how many messages it wants and get back the cyphertext and compute it as much it
	wants.
2 What is the difference between an IV and a nonce?
	*Nonce a number only used once.
	*IV(initialization vector): has to be 
	
3 What is the difference between a protocol and an algorithm?
4 Describe the CBC and CTR block-cipher modes.
5 For symmetric encryption with a block cipher using CBC-mode, what is the consequence of:
	1 Using a predictable IV?
	2 Reusing an IV?
6 How is ROT13 related to the Caesar cipher? Give an example.
7 Assume that you compress a message m as part of encrypting it with a
semantically secure encryption algorithm: does this break semantic security? Explain why (not).
